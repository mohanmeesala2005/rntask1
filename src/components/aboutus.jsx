             It is with immense pleasure and an enthusiastic heart that we, the creative team behind Radio NITroz, welcome you to the world of amusement and entertainment. At NIT Durgapur, we believe that college life is meant to be relished, and Radio NITroz is on a mission to add that extra flavor to your already colorful journey. Our intention to provide you with entertainment started way back in 2006, which led us to start the club, and since then Radio NITroz has come a long way since after we moved to Youtube community with exciting Podcasts,Success story and Freshers intro. Remember the days when you could tune into Radio NITroz via VLC and dedicate songs to your loved ones? It was a fantastic feeling to be showered with love and appreciation! We organize various events throughout the year that cater to different interests. Take, for instance, our 'Meme-RaN-Tine' event, where participants can showcase their sense of humor, or 'Movie Mystics,' where we pose exciting riddles related to movies. We believe that talent is just a word until you reveal it, and to expose your talent is our excitement as we came up with our most exciting event 'Talent X' and also our 'Voice It Out' event that provides a platform for live poem recitations, creating a striking ambiance for all. And how can we forget 'Khol E Dil,' where your confession isn't left unconfessed anymore! We also cherish our cultural heritage and organize events such as 'Matki Fod' on the auspicious occasion of Janmashtami and 'Shaam-E-Noor,' an online event on Diwali to celebrate, where every smile of yours is shared with our ever-growing family.And how can we forget Recstacy (now Nityamini) - the Cultural Fest of NIT Durgapur, where we host a myriad of exciting events like Dare you and pull N move! As a team, we make sure that every event we organize becomes a milestone. Our club is more like a family that aims to connect with people, acting as college media and spreading joy and laughter throughout the campus. So, come join us, and let's fill our lives with some fun and entertainment!
